            <h1>Hello,</h1><br>

            <p>&emsp;My name is Poom Lynn, and I’m the face behind Silly Daisy. It all started with a love of beautiful fabric and a passion for making fun and good quality clothing for my daughter. After getting carried away in beautiful local fabric stores in Portland, OR, I had amassed a large stockpile of fabric that was begging for a purpose; so Silly Daisy was born. When my kids moved on to full-time schooling in October 2017, I finally had the time to develop my enthusiasm for fabric hoarding and sewing into something more. I began selling my children's apparel and baby accessories on Etsy and at local craft fairs, and later had my products in shops around Portland, OR.
            <br><br>&emsp;In early 2019, I added my own storefront when I joined a group of local makers and artists in a collective shop called Plural Collective in Sellwood, Portland. It has always been my dream to have my own shop selling things that matter to me: products from small, environmentally-conscious and ethically-run businesses. ⠀ ⠀
            <br><br>&emsp;I hope you like what you see here. If you have any questions, please reach out.
            <br><br>Warmly,
            <br>&emsp;Poom Lynn</p>
